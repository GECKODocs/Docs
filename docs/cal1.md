## Calendar

Calendar view of different tasks, their associated due date and status.

User permission level i.e. Tasks displayed on the calendar can be filtered here to view only “My Tasks,” (tasks assigned specifically to you) and “All Tasks” (relating to all users)

At a superuser level, you can easily drag and drop different tasks across the calendar assigning them to different users
