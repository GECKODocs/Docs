## Calendar

The Calendar page provides a view of different tasks, their associated **due date**, and **status**.

Tasks displayed on the calendar can be filtered to view “**My Tasks**” - tasks assigned specifically to you - and “**All Tasks**” - tasks relating to all users.

Depending on your permission level, you can **drag and drop tasks across the calendar** to different dates, assigning them to different users.

You can traverse through months using the forward and backward arrows above the calendar on the top right.

:::important note
**Subtasks** are currently differentiated from **parent tasks** on the calendar with a preceding(s).
